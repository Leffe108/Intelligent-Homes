Intelligent-Homes
=================

How many times haven't you heard about intelligent homes that are promised to come in the future? Yet technically we already have the technologies to do it. Now you have the chance to sell intelligent fridges as a service to homes and work places. Deal with keeping fridges supplied so that they never run out of food.

# Controls
The game is played using left mouse button. Click on buildings to show available actions. You cannot scroll the map, so don't try to figure out how to do it. :-)
